Building a calculator is a very basic challenge that most beginners start with.

The program prompts the user to enter one number on the first line
The program then prompts the user to enter a second number on another line
The program finally prompts the user to enter a mathematical operation

Assume that the numbers entered on the first and second line are integers (whole numbers, not decimals)
There should be 4 available operations:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division

You need to take the two numbers given as input and apply the chosen operation to the 2 numbers.
Your program should return one number, it can be an integer OR a float (whole or decimal)

Hints:
Use the input() function to get user input
Use an if statement to check what operation the user has selected
